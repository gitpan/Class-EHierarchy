CHANGELOG

v0.90 (2011/08/18)
==================
--Completely rewritten into something (hopefully) more useful than the
  original incarnation.  Completely breaks old API and loses some
  functionality, while gaining some new functionality.  Possibly more
  congruent with the actual OOP concepts it claims to follow.

v0.06 (2003/03/18)
==================
--Old version.  Should be ashamed of itself.  May it die in obscurity.
