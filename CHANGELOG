CHANGELOG

v0.92 (2013/06/18)
==================
--Added more relationship methods
--Added alias functionality
--Updated & improved documentation
--Bumped minimum required perl to 5.8.3

v0.91 (2012/01/30)
==================
--Added automated loading of methods, properties, and default property
  values via class variables
--Fixed bug where every object created rewraps scoped methods in the 
  class symbol table
--Improved documentation with better examples and explanations

v0.90 (2011/08/18)
==================
--Completely rewritten into something (hopefully) more useful than the
  original incarnation.  Completely breaks old API and loses some
  functionality, while gaining some new functionality.  Possibly more
  congruent with the actual OOP concepts it claims to follow.

v0.06 (2003/03/18)
==================
--Old version.  Should be ashamed of itself.  May it die in obscurity.
